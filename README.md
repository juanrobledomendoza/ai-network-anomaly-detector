# AI Network Anomaly Detector
AI-powered anomaly detection system using Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor to identify unusual patterns in data. Inspired by Krish Naik’s tutorial and adapted for cybersecurity, demonstrating how AI can detect suspicious network activity for SOC and blue-team defense.

## Features
- Detects anomalies in synthetic or network-style data
- Uses Isolation Forest and Local Outlier Factor (LOF)
- Visualizes results with Matplotlib scatter plots
- Demonstrates AI’s role in modern blue-team defense

## Tech Stack
Python · Pandas · Scikit-learn · Matplotlib

## Output Example
Red = anomalous activity  
Blue = normal data
